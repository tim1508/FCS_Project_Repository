# Fadri, Tim, Nick, Liam, Tibauld, Gabriel, Fabio, Malte, Sean, Yanick

# This is our Streamlit application for the HSG Reporting Tool. We worked the last six weeks on this code for our Computer Science Group Project.
# Our tool solves the problem of facility issues on the HSG campus. You can just submit your issue through our Streamlit application and it gets stored in a database.
# It is even possible for the facility management team to overwrite the status of the submitted issues. Therefore this application has a real use case!

# Our app is accessible via https://groupsixpointtwo.streamlit.app/

# Please make sure to submit an issue on the first page so a database can be created on your device. Otherwise the second page will raise an error for the charts.
# Additionally you need the HSG logo downloaded and named HSG-logo-new.png

# Information just for Facility Management Team and Computer Science Course Team:
# The Password for the third page "Overwrite Status" is Group6.2 (see line 336)
